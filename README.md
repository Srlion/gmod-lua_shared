# Garry's Mod lua_shared.dll/so

This repository is updated monthly with the latest `lua_shared.dll` and its necessary files for Garry's Mod, for every branch. You can get it for main, x86, and x86_64, for both Linux and Windows. You can find them in the releases tab.
The updates are done automatically with a GitHub Action, so you don't have to worry about it being modified.

## Why?

I do some code generation that requires using `lua_shared.dll/so` because it has some differences from LuaJIT. Therefore, I figured it would be useful to have a repository with the latest versions without having to grab them from the game files for each platform.
